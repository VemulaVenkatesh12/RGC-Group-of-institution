          Tobacco cessation cell in a dental institution, where an Oral Medicine specialist does the behavioural counseling during which patients are advised to stop the tobacco habits, with customized structured counseling methods. Intervention to stop the habit is performed in the form of questions and scores. Based on the patientâ€™s response, a quit date is set after which the patient should not be performing the habit at all.The scores also determine whether the patient requires Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)/any other medicines in the form of drugs so as to reduce the cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with stopping the habit.Tobacco cessation cell has been functional in Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology in Sri Rajiv Gandhi College of Dental Sciences and Hospital, Cholanagar since 2014.
